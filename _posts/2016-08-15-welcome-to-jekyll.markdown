Sitting here hacking away on some Python and had a thought: *Why do I not have a GitHub account that is packed with code?* I have plenty in DropBox and various files on multiple computers. However, that is nothing out there in the wild. To compound this point, an associate hit me up about this various thing late last week. So, here I am blogging about things that matter to me in regards to code, coding, data, and technology. 

Random Python code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
 note_words = [i.replace('//','') for i in note_words if i]
{% endhighlight %}

I am using Jekyll and loving it. OMG! I'd say Jekyll's ease of use is the final motivator for me to get online. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
